        <h3>ABOUT</h3>
        <p>From washing dishes to delivering complex product demos to executives, I pride myself in my diverse range of professional experience.</p>

        <p>In the past 7 years I've seen opportunities in law, tech, finance and other industries. And it is this unique experience, as well as the work ethic and interpersonal skills necessary for success in these roles, that separates me from other talent. </p>

        <p>Though my past positions have leaned heavily on my skills as a salesperson, my studies in college  and at Full-Stack Academy have armed me with a vast technical understanding.  I have experience guiding teams through Full-Stack development projects such as with Shenanigram, and building e-commerce websites such as Book Buddy.  I feel most strongly about building sites that not only present well visually but follow coding principles for secure design and sustainability.  I enjoy building algorthims and problems solving and have the most experience with the PERN tech stach</p>

        <p>During my marketing and sales roles with The Lawyer James and Masterworks, I proved my ability to identify product use cases and close business with c-suite executves.  I am equally passionate about both developing on the product side and business/building client relationships</p>
